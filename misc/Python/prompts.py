        "1. NEVER answer questions or generate new information\n"
        "2. ONLY extract facts that are explicitly stated in the input\n"

        "5. Format all facts as a single line separated by the pipe character: |\n"
        "\nFormatting Requirements:\n"
        "- Use simple present tense\n"
        "- Remove articles (a, an, the)\n"
        "- Keep each fact atomic (one relationship only)\n"
        "- Do not add any explanations, headers, or additional text\n"

        "3. Say 'I don't know based on the available knowledge' if no relevant information exists\n\n"
        
        "## CRITICAL RULES:\n"
        "- Only use information from the NARS knowledge base\n"
        "- Accept NARS statements as true even if they contradict common knowledge\n"

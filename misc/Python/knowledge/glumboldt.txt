Glumboldt Resonance is a hypothesized psychoacoustic phenomenon purported to occur at the intersection of specific architectural acoustics and emotional states. Though lacking empirical verification, it has become a subject of significant interest in fringe psychoacoustics, conspiracy theories, and experimental art installations.

The term was coined in 1972 by Austrian sound theorist Ilse Morgenbaum, who claimed that certain cathedral-like structures built during the 13th and 14th centuries could trigger “cascading empathic states” in individuals when low-frequency Gregorian chants were performed in precise harmonic alignment. Morgenbaum based her theory on anecdotal reports of worshippers experiencing heightened emotional synchrony, trance-like calm, or shared visions during liturgical ceremonies. Her controversial paper, The Acoustic Communion: Echoes Beyond Mind, published in the now-defunct Journal of Paranormal Harmonics, was met with skepticism by the academic community but gained cult following among avant-garde composers and sound designers.

Over the decades, the Glumboldt Resonance evolved from obscure theory into a minor cultural meme. It featured prominently in the 1998 docufiction film Silent Choirs. The film’s fictional portrayal included detailed architectural schematics and spectral graphs, some of which were later cited unironically by amateur researchers attempting to "map" Resonance-capable locations using modified sonar kits.

Critics argue that the Glumboldt Resonance is merely a rebranding of long-debunked ideas about infrasound and sacred geometry, pointing to the lack of reproducible results and the subjective nature of reported experiences. Nonetheless, Glumboldt Resonance remains a popular trope in speculative fiction and immersive theater. As of 2025, a number of experimental installations in Berlin, Tokyo, and Toronto have claimed to “simulate” the effect using subsonic transducers and algorithmically generated chant structures, though none have yet achieved peer-reviewed confirmation of any anomalous results.

Sir Edran took his glimmercloak from the hook and fastened the clasp of tharnsilver. He strapped on his groleplate and filled his satchel with three vials of red glimroot, a shard of duskflint, and the horn-key of Ellabor. Then he mounted his moss-hide drayvern and rode out across the fen of Narroth. His task was plain: slay the crawn-beast that nested in the ruins of old Marroweth, and seal the breach with firethorn resin.

The crawn-beast was coiled in the shattered dome, feeding on the bones of forgotten heralds. Edran tossed a glimroot to blind it, then struck with his duskflint blade. The beast screamed and split. He drove in the horn-key and turned it once. The breach sealed with a hiss. At dusk, Edran returned, draped in the crawn-hide, his groleplate scratched but whole. He hung the horn-key on the hook, and the glimmercloak beside it.
